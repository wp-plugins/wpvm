WPVM - WordPress Varnish Modified
---------------------------------

WPVM (WordPress Varnish Modified) purges pages on Varnish caching servers automatically as content is updated or on demand.

This project is experimental. Stick to WP-Varnish for production use.

WPVM is based on WP-Varnish plugin v0.8, available at https://github.com/pkhamre/wp-varnish.

This project exists for personal experimentation. Most of my changes are
contributed back upstream.

Feature requests are not accepted at this time, unless they are accompanied by
a tested patch.

Development takes place at:

    https://github.com/gnotaras/wordpress-varnish-modified

Branches:

    'master': custom plugin
    'master-upstream': sync with upstream in order to develop patches.
