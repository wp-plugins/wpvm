WPVM (WordPress Varnish Modified) purges pages from Varnish caching servers either automatically as content is updated or on demand.

== Description ==

*WPVM* started as a fork of [WP-Varnish](https://github.com/pkhamre/wp-varnish)
plugin v0.8, but now it is developed independently.

The core of WP-Varnish that generates the URLs that need to be purged has been
rewritten from scratch in order to be as complete as possible. Several other
improvements have been implemented and bugs have been fixed. Many of my changes
have been contributed upstream.

Although this plugin is meant to 'just work', it should be considered **experimental**.

Feature requests are not accepted at this time, unless they are accompanied by
a tested patch which adds a needed feature.
