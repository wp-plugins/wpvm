WPVM (WordPress Varnish Modified) purges pages from Varnish caching servers either automatically as content is updated or on demand.

== Description ==

*WPVM* is possibly the most advanced and most complete plugin you can find to purge your cached content of your WordPress powered web site from Varnish caches.

*WPVM* version 1 started as a fork of [WP-Varnish](https://github.com/pkhamre/wp-varnish)
plugin v0.8 in order to send patches upstream, but for various reasons it ended up being developed independently.

*WPVM* version 2 is an almost complete rewrite of the original code.
