*WPVM* (WordPress Varnish Modified) purges pages on Varnish caching servers automatically as content is updated or on demand.

== Description ==

This project should be considered **experimental**.

*WPVM* is based on [WP-Varnish](https://github.com/pkhamre/wp-varnish) plugin v0.8.

The core of WP-Varnish that generates the URLs that need to be purged has been
rewritten from scratch. Several other improvements have been implemented and
bugs have been fixed. Most of my changes have been contributed upstream.

This project exists for personal experimentation.
